Simple slideshow maker, simple and familiar user interface.

But, one key difference: durations of images edited in one text editor pane, which is more flexible and saves time.

### Understanding the problems
* Setting the duration of every clip by hand is very time consuming
* You made a slideshow, but want to change or reorder some images, so you should set timings again
* You friend made a good timings. You like it. Do you think of your friend sharing the timings, but how he is going to share? A whole project?

### Solution: all duration are going to set in one text box:
* Simple, easy. You can select, copy, paste. There are a lot variety of text editors which gives useful opportunities. (format, replace, remove appearances)
* All durations are saved in text box, so you can do anything with clips, durations wouldn't change
* It is just a text, so you can easily share it across the messengers
